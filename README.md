# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective-

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
      I interpreted the users needs through the user stories. User stories are descriptive wants and needs that the user is looking to experience. In order to implement this into the program is fairly simple. By analyzing the customers needs and simply adding exactly what the user asked for into the program.



2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The best way to approach all developing programs is with a Scrum team using the Agile methodology discussed in the SDLC. Constant communication and role transparency are two agile processes that I hope to incorporate into my future development work!



3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Like I said before, having constant communication with other team members is important for being a good team member in software development.
